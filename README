I decided on a Saturday 3 May 2014 morning that it would be a good idea to make a bootstrap tool for OpenMandriva Lx.
This was not only for my comfort in not having to boot up a bloody VM every time to develop, but also
for those people who don't want a graphical environment to install a simple distribution, like in server environments.

So I made this. On the first weekend I was free. Out of all the things I could have spent my 24 hours of relaxation
on, I spent it on this. Just for the hell of it. What was I thinking?!

And now, finals approach. (save me pls)

Requirements:
    python2
    bash
    cpio
    xz/lzma/gzip/bzip2 [depending on the package compression]
        this is usually xz nowadays

Usage:
    git clone https://github.com/robxu9/omvbootstrap.git
    cd omvbootstrap
    sudo ./omvbootstrap -h
